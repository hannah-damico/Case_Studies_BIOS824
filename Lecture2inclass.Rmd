```{r}
# install.packages("cli")

```{r}
# remotes::install_github("rstudio/r2d3")
```

Write the code necessary to load the library.

```{r}
library(r2d3)
```

You will need to create the 'barchart.js' file and also the CSS file 'chord.css'. I prefer putting my javascript files in a 'js' folder and my css files in a 'css' folder. Need to update the example code.

```


You will need to create the 'chord.js' file and also the CSS file 'chord.css'. I prefer putting my javascript files in a 'js' folder and my css files in a 'css' folder. Need to update the example code.

```



```{r}
plot(cars)
