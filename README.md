# Case_Studies_BIOS824
A collection of assignments from BIOSTAT 824 organized through version control

Course Outline
This course will cover biomedical data science case studies, focusing on visualization and supervised machine learning.  The two topics will be interleaved, with both covered the first day, and each subsequent class day focusing on one or the other.  For organizational purposes, we present the two areas separately below.  Students will be notified at least a week in advance which area will be the focus of the subsequent week.

Data Visualization
Module Description:

This module is about data visualization - the art and science of using visualization (graphics) to enhance the exploration, understanding, and extraction of information and knowledge from data. Data visualization is an essential component of the analysis toolkit in any data-driven research endeavor. Data visualization in this module includes data modeling, data processing (such as aggregation and filtering), and mapping data attributes to graphical attributes. This module will present multiple data visualization techniques and provide a conceptual framework for understanding the role of data presentation and visualization in conveying information to the viewer. Data scientists, biostatisticians, analysts, and experts of all types can scan and comprehend enormous volumes of data through well-designed visualizations. Well-designed data visualization can also facilitate new discoveries. Poorly done visualization, or visualization with ill-intent can also mislead, bias, and slow down comprehension or identification of key findings. This module will focus on the role of data visualization in biomedical data analysis applications. Students will learn to evaluate the effectiveness of visualization designs and think critically about visualization. Students will create their own data visualizations and learn to use open source data visualization tools in R - ggplot2 and plotly.
